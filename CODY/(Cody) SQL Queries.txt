Notes - [brackets] indicate a variable or user fill-in from the page in the example query

//New User

User fills out page, upon clicking Submit run query

INSERT INTO Users (Username, FName, LName, Password, Email) VALUES ('[Username_Field]', '[FirstName_Field]', '[LastName_Field]', '[Password_Field]', '[Email_Field]');

then return to the login page.

 

//Login

User fills in username and password, upon clicking Submit run query

SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = '[Username_Field]';

and compare return to [Password_Field].

If equal then run query

SELECT UserID FROM Users WHERE Username = '[Username_Field]';

and save the UserID to a permanent variable that can be transferred from page to page.

Else reject login and display an error.


 
//Choose Project

To dynamically fill in the page, run the following query

SELECT ProjectName FROM Projects, ProjectMembers WHERE (PMUserID = [UserID_Variable]) AND (ProjectID = PMProjectID);

then set the project names on the page as choose-able links.  

Once a link is chosen, run the following query

SELECT ProjectID FROM Projects WHERE ProjectName = '[ProjectName_Chosen]';

And save as a permanent variable that can be taken page to page.
 


//Create Project

User fills out the form, upon Submit run the query

INSERT INTO Projects (ProjectName, ProjectSummary) VALUES ('[ProjectName_Field]','[ProjectSummary_Field]');

Then we must add the creating user to the new project for access, save the new ProjectID to a temp variable

SELECT ProjectID FROM Projects WHERE ProjectName = ‘[ProjectName_Field]’;

and insert it into the ProjectMembers table

INSERT INTO ProjectMembers VALUES ('[ProjectID_Temp_Variable]', '[UserID_Variable]');

then take back to the Choose Project page.

 

//User Preferences

To dynamically fill in the page, run the query

SELECT Username, FName, LName, Password, Email FROM Users WHERE UserID = [UserID_Variable];

then fill the data into the appropriate fields on the webpage form.

User can change everything but UserID, upon clicking Submit run update query

UPDATE Users SET Username = [Username_Field], FName = [FName_Field], LName = [LName_Field], Password = [Password_Field], Email = [Email_Field] WHERE UserID = [UserID_Variable];

else cancel takes you back to Choose Project.



//Project Preferences

To dynamically fill in project info, run the query

SELECT ProjectName, ProjectSummary FROM Projects WHERE ProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable];

then fill in the appropriate form fields on the webpage form.

To fill in to User Access area of who has access to this project, run the query

SELECT Username FROM Users, ProjectMembers WHERE (PMProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable]) AND (UserID = PMUserID);

To show all usernames for an add member to project function, run the query

SELECT Username FROM Users;

User can change everything but ProjectID, upon clicking submit run update query

UPDATE Projects SET ProjectName = [ProjectName_Field], ProjectSummary = [ProjectSummary_Field] WHERE ProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable];

To add a user for access, choose a username and get their UserID by running the query

SELECT UserID FROM Users WHERE Username = '[Username_Choosen]';

and save to a temp variable then run the query

INSERT INTO ProjectMembers VALUES ([ProjectID_Variable], [UserID_Temp]);

To remove a user from access, choose a username and get their UserID by running the query

SELECT UserID FROM Users WHERE Username = '[Username_Chosen]';

and save to a temp variable then run the query

DELETE FROM ProjectMembers WHERE (PMProjectID = [ProjectID Variable]) AND (PMUserID = [UserID_Temp]);

 

//Project Hub

Just displays links to the three main pages (Tasks, Bugs and Forum) however we can display project info at the top by running the query

SELECT ProjectName, ProjectSummary FROM Projects WHERE ProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable];

and parsing the data to the form.

 

//Tasks

To dynamically fill in the table on the page (sorted by Task ID), run the query

SELECT TaskID, Priority, Task, Complete, Username, SCRUM, Remarks FROM Tasks, Users WHERE (TProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable]) AND (UserID = TAssignedID);

then fill in the appropriate form fields on the webpage form.

To populate the assigned user dropdown, run the query

SELECT Username FROM Users, ProjectMembers WHERE (PMProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable]) AND (UserID = PMUserID);

To get the chosen usernames UserID:

SELECT UserID FROM Users WHERE Username = '[Username_Chosen]';

And save to a UsedID temp variable.

To add new task run the query

INSERT INTO Tasks (Priority, Task, Complete, SCRUM, Remarks, TProjectID, TAssignedID) VALUES ('[Priority_Field]','[Task_Field]','[Complete_Field]', [SCRUM_Field], '[Remarks_Field]', [ProjectID_Variable], [UserID_Temp_Variable]);

User can change all fields except Task ID, upon clicking Submit run update query

UPDATE Tasks SET Priority = [Priority_Field], Task = [Tasks_Field], Complete [Complete_Field], SCRUM = [SCRUM_Field], Remarks = [Remarks_Field], TProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable], TAssignedID = [UserID_Temp_Variable] WHERE TaskID = [ValueOf_TaskID_Field];



//Bugs

To dynamically fill in the table on the page (sorted by BugID), run the query

SELECT BugID, Users1.Username, Users2.Username, SourceFile, Location, Description, Status FROM Bugs, Users Users1, Users Users2 WHERE (BProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable]) AND (Users1.UserID = BReporterID) AND (Users2.UserID = BAssignedID);

then fill in the appropriate form fields on the webpage form.

To populate the assigned and reporter user dropdown options, run the query

SELECT Username FROM Users, ProjectMembers WHERE (PMProject = [ProjectID_Variable]) AND (UserID = PMUserID);

To get the chosen usernames UserID, run the query

SELECT UserID FROM Users WHERE Username = '[Username_Chosen]';

and add to a temp variable for either Assigned or Reporter.

To add new bug, run the query

INSERT INTO Bugs (SourceFile, Location, Description, Status, BProjectID, BReporterID, BAssignedID) VALUES ('[SourceFile_Field]', '[Location_Field]', '[Description_Field]', '[Status_Field]', [ProjectID_Variable], [ReporterID_Temp_Variable], [AssignedID_Temp_Variable]);

User can change all fields but BugID, upon clicking Submit run update query

UPDATE Bugs SET SourceFile = (SourceFile_Field), Location = (Location_Field), Description = (Description_Field), Status = (Status_Field), BProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable], BReporterID = [ReporterID_Temp_Variable], BAssignedID = [AssignedID_Temp_Variable] WHERE BugID = [ValueOf_BugID_Field];



//Forum

To dynamically fill in the table on the page (Oldest to Newest), run the query

SELECT Username, Comment FROM Users, Forum WHERE (FProjectID = [ProjectID_Variable]) AND (UserID = FUserID);
